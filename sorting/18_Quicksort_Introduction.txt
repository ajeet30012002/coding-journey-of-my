Quick sort Algorithm:-
-> Divide and conquer Algorithm
{ It is similar to that of merge sort algorithm in mergesort merge function is complex In quick sort Partation function is complex}
->Worst case Time :O(n2)
->Despite O(n2) worst case, it is considered faster, Because of the following reasons:-
   1> In-Place [Does not require any Extra space]

   2>cache Friendly[It's Working in same same array so it works fastly]

   3>Average case is O(nlogn)

   4>Tail Recursion
->Partation is key Function(Naive,Lomuto,Hoare)
->Quick sort is not an stable algorithms
